The problem is that the heat from the left side of the bar
reaches the right side \textit{instantly}. This violates special
relativity which prohibits information from traveling at speeds
greater than that of light. We correct for this by considering
the \textit{relativistic heat equation}:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{v^{2}}
    \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial{t}^{2}}
    +
    \frac{1}{\alpha}\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{t}}
    =
    \frac{\partial^{2}u}{\partial{x}^{2}}
\end{equation}

where $v$ is the \textit{second sound velocity}. It is interesting to note
that this is a combination of the heat equation and the wave equation.
For large $\alpha$ one may thus approximate heat using waves,
and so this equation predicts the existence of \textit{thermal waves}.
